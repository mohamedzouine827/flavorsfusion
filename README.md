Chef Website Portfolio Project
Introduction
Welcome to the Chef Website Portfolio project! This project is a hands-on exercise in web development, focusing on creating a portfolio website for a chef. Please note that this website is not fully functional as it serves as a practice project. To make it fully functional, it would require customization based on the specific needs and preferences of a real customer.

Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to present a visually appealing and user-friendly portfolio website for a chef. The website includes three main sections: Home, About, and Hire. These sections are designed to provide essential information about the chef, their background, and how potential customers can hire them for culinary services.

Features
Home: The landing page offers a warm welcome and a brief introduction to the chef. Users can quickly get a sense of the chef's style and personality.

About: In this section, users can delve deeper into the chef's background, including their culinary journey, experiences, and passion for cooking. It's a chance for visitors to connect with the chef on a personal level.

Hire: This section is dedicated to potential customers who are interested in hiring the chef for special events, catering, or other culinary services. Users can find contact information and details on how to make inquiries or bookings.

Project Status
As of now, this project is a static representation of what the final website could look like. It does not include advanced functionality such as backend operations, form submissions, or database interactions. The project is intended for practice purposes, and to make it fully functional, real customer input and requirements are crucial.

How to Run
To view the website locally, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. Since it's a static website, there's no need for a server or any additional setup.
